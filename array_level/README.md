# Array Flatten Code Challenge
## Description
The challenge presented is as follows:

1. Write an algorithm to flatten an arbitrarily nested array of values.

## Proposed Solution
Given Ruby has `flatten` defined on instances of `Array`, a new method `level` will be implemented.
 
 As Ruby classes are completely open the method will be added to the `Array
 ` class to be available on instances of `Array`.

## Solution
To include the solution in your project please include the gem in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'array_level', 'url goes here'
```

## Files
- specs for the new method are included in the `specs` folder.
- implementation is found in `lib`
